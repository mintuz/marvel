# Principles

Marvel has been built with 4 principles

## User first

The web is for everyone and Marvel has been built with an accessibility first approach.

The system should provide accessible components and prevent developers from making mistakes that can lead to accessibility issues.

## Meaningful defaults

Treat the system as a blackbox, a developer should be able to pick a component and it work out of the box. Configuration should be optional but possible.

## Powerful Abstractions

Every component provided by Marvel should be built with composition in mind allowing developers to build entire pages using only Marvel components.

For those times where Marvel hasnâ€™t provided an abstraction, the system should not fight against the developer and allow interoperability between the system and developer defined components.

## Everyone owns the system

The system should not be controlled by a single entity or developer, everyone using the system should be able to make suggestions, changes and opinions about the system.
