Marvel is a reusable component library that helps projects get off the ground quickly. The goal is to make common components that are both performant and accessible by default.

## Install

Marvel components are written in React, using `styled-components`

Add Marvel to your project.

`yarn add @mintuz/marvel react react-dom styled-components --save`

## Usage

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button } from '@mintuz/marvel';`

and use them like so

```
  const Example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => {console.log('Clicked');}}>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
```
